# 🐺 Features & Active Sprint

**Version:** v0.1.67 - 2026-05-24

> [!NOTE]
> This document describes the **Features** — i.e., the functional value exposed to the end user, both as engine capabilities and UI interfaces. It does not describe how the data is structured (→ `STRUCTURE.md`) nor the temporal execution flow (→ `PIPELINE.md`).

## Core Capabilities (Stringout AI Engine)

### 1. Single Track Cut (Stringout Workflow)
The system extrapolates a single optimized timeline to maximize offline post-production speed:
- **Stringout Track:** Gathers all usable fragments of the footage, classifying them semantically (MAIN_A, B-ROLL, EDGE_DANGER).
- **Trash Reel:** A parallel timeline invisible to the final EDL but rendered in `.mp4` (preview_TRASH) for visual Quality Control of what the algorithm discarded.

### 2. Physical Filters and Saliency (Action Peak)
- **Center-Weighted Focus:** The Laplacian filter calculates blur exclusively on the central 50% of the frame, tolerating fast lenses and strong bokeh effects at the sides.
- **Dual Threshold Soft Focus:** Strictly selects frames: `TRASH_BLUR` below `10.0`, while the "gray zone" (10-25) is allowed in the timeline but tagged with the `_SOFT` suffix (e.g., `MAIN_A_SOFT`).
- **MOTION_THRESHOLD:** Discards extreme camera movements or shaking (threshold `40.0`).
- **Action Peak (Best Moment):** Real-time tracking of sharpness peaks. The engine stores the temporary key `_max_lap` and certifies the `best_moment` (the exact millisecond of the perfect frame) in the clip metadata for subsequent LLMs.
- **Boundary Crossing Split:** Proxy cuts that cross the boundary of the original clip are dynamically split during EDL export to prevent "Media Offline" errors or zebra patterns in Adobe Premiere.
- **Chromatic DNA (Cinematic Palette):** Using K-Means Clustering via OpenCV, the algorithm extracts the 5 dominant HEX colors of each clip on the fly. Sampling merges 3 matrices (IN, OUT, and BEST) for perfect color continuity without weighing on CPU and RAM performance (Zero-Seeking).
- **Optical Flow (Motion Scoring):** Ultra-lightweight `Farneback` vector calculation at 160x90 for each block. Returns `motion_intensity` (float) and `camera_direction` (PAN_LEFT, PAN_RIGHT, TILT_UP, TILT_DOWN, STATIC) in the nested `technical_quality` macro-object of `stringout.json`.
- **Semantic Storyboard & Smart Naming:** On-the-fly extraction of three frames (IN, BEST, OUT) at 480x270, merged horizontally. The extracted frames are no longer anonymous but intercept the REAL native name (`C4369`) from the EDL map and the safe timecode calculated by the engine, generating `{clip_name}_{tc_safe}.jpg`.

### 3. PHASE B - Vision LLM Inference (MLX Server)
The Engine is no longer "blind". Integrating the local MLX ecosystem via an OpenAI-compatible standard (`http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/chat/completions`), the system analyzes the Stringout timeline:
- Converting the Semantic Storyboard to `base64` on the fly and sending the technical YOLO context (number of subjects detected in the scene).
- Iniezione della modalità Reasoning di Gemma 4 tramite token `<|think|>` inserito a inizio prompt di sistema per abilitare il motore di pensiero nativo.
- Parametri di sampling dedicati: `temperature=1.0`, `top_p=0.95`, `top_k=64`.
- Parsing robusto dei dati: estrazione greedy regex del blocco JSON esterno che ignora i tag di pensiero `<|channel>thought`.
- Ricezione di un payload JSON strutturato nidificato in **5 macro-oggetti** che arricchisce ciascuna clip:
  - `cinematography` → `scene_description`, `lighting_type`, `visual_quality_score`, `technical_flaws`, `shot_size`
  - `semantic_analysis` → `subject_action`, `gaze_direction`, `emotional_tone`, `narrative_energy_score`, `subject_screen_position`, `subject_count`, `setting_location`, `key_props`
  - `continuity` → `action_description`, `emotion_arc`, `match_cut_potential`, `match_cut_vector`
  - `commercial` → `product_visibility`, `brand_safe`, `reaction_type`
  - `story` → `narrative_role`, `recommended_position`, `director_note`
- Saving the validated result in the JSON dict through tolerant and autonomous logic (retry x3, regex cleaning, explicit structured fallback for each sub-key, progressive atomic JSON saving post-clip).
- Morphological bypass (Soft Skip) for automatic ingest if the MLX server is not started.
- **Native Apple Silicon Integration**: The Python environment (`engine/requirements.txt`) is natively equipped with the `mlx` and `mlx-lm` frameworks for direct LLM inference on Unified Memory, without depending on external servers.

### 4. Flexible Drop-Zone Automation
- **Agnostic Ingest:** Extended support for `.mp4`, `.mov`, `.mxf`, `.avi`, `.mkv`.
- **Auto-Cleanup:** Once the EDL file is issued (`_Stringout_Cut.edl`), original files in the drop zone are cleaned up and moved directly to the output folder of their respective sequence to avoid residue.
- **Direct Export:** Removed manual gate [Y/N]; the engine processes proxies, calculates discards, and generates CMX3600 in total autonomy at 50fps.

### 5. PHASE D - AI Director (HITL Constraint Resolution)
The Director is the module that closes the loop between AI analysis and human decisions:
- **LLM Editing Recipe:** Gemma 4 receives the list of usable clips (with Scores, Scene, Action Strategy) and produces a JSON `editing_recipe` defining the narrative order and musical beats assigned to each clip.
- **Beat-Sync Math:** The LLM recipe is applied to a mathematical grid of beat timestamps (`_audio_beats.json`). Each clip is truncated/extended to synchronize perfectly with the musical rhythm.
- **Pillar & Filler System:** Clips with user-defined BM (Best Moment) markers become PILLARS anchored to the nearest beat. Clips without constraints become FILLERS, ordered by `visual_quality_score` as a tie-breaker.
- **Safety Net Auto-Fill:** If the LLM recipe is too short compared to the target duration, the Director autonomously triggers a 4-beat heuristic fallback to fill the remaining gaps.
- **Audio Rhythm Engine API:** Decoupled REST endpoints (`/api/audio/files` e `/api/audio/analyze`) che permettono alla dashboard UI di listare file audio ed estrarre dinamicamente i transienti (BPM, durata, inviluppo) usando Librosa senza bloccare la main thread.
- **Local Versioning & State Rehydration:** Every execution of the Director preserves the past history natively (`_final_edit_vN.json` and `_gemma_recipe_vN.json`) with an indexed `_version_log.json`. The UI allows non-destructive time-travel across versions via a dedicated rehydration dropdown in the Dashboard.
- **Dual-Track Export:** Produces `_final_edit.json` (symlink-like pointer for latest timeline) + `_FinalCut.xml` (FCP7 XML ready for Premiere/FCPX) + `_gemma_recipe.json` (latest AI reasoning).

## Frontend (React HITL Dashboard)

### 1. NLE-Style Split-View
- **Interactive Timeline**: Timebar synchronized to the millisecond, chromatically rendering valid (Green MAIN, Blue B-ROLL) and discarded (Red) segments. Supports dynamic filters (ALL/VALID/BROLL/TRASH) that leave physical empty spaces ("black holes") to respect timing.
- **Auto-Scrolling Vertical Playlist**: The side inspector autonomously scrolls and keeps the active clip in focus on the video player, ensuring an immersive UX.
- **Multi-Anchor System (BM/IN/OUT)**: Human editors can apply multiple temporal constraints (markers) on the same clip by pressing `M`, `I`, `O`. Surgically removable and frame-accurate via `X`, or displayed as an interactive list directly in the ClipCard.
- **Non-Destructive Forced Overrides**: `K` (Keep), `T` (Trash), and `B` (B-Roll) keys allow the human to override the AI, forcing the clip state. Changes are instantly visualized with glows and badges (e.g., `FORCED B-ROLL`) and saved in parallel on a sidecar JSON.
- **Professional Keyboard Shortcuts**: Standard integration for editing. Space for Play/Pause, horizontal arrows for scrubbing (10 frames base, +Shift for 1 frame, +Alt for 30 frames), vertical arrows to instantly "jump" to next/previous cuts calculated by the Engine. Info popup "on-click" for all timelines.
- **Anti-Lag Engine (60fps)**: Time data-binding completely detached from React State and offloaded to a direct `requestAnimationFrame` on the DOM. React re-renders are blocked via `React.memo` except when the video passes a real cut of the virtual EDL.
- **Director Settings Panel & Advanced Modal**: The user can access an advanced panel `🎨 AI Director Creative Settings` (via createPortal to bypass z-index limits) to set *Target Product*, *Expected Subjects*, *Focus Area*, and NLP parameters, saved inside the `DirectorConfig`.
- **Dynamic Hardware Profiler & Trinity Startup**: The entire ecosystem (React + Python) boots in parallel with a single command (`npm run wolf:dev`). The integrated hardware widget no longer uses mocked data but reads the profile from the backend (`/api/system/profiler`), which extracts the exact chip model and Unified RAM by querying the macOS kernel (`sysctl`) natively. ETA and inference batches (Chunks) are calculated mathematically in real-time.
- **Pannello di Telemetria delle Performance**: Visualizza sopra il Video Player i dati dell'ultima elaborazione eseguita dalla pipeline Python (inclusi modello VLM compatto, frame analizzati e durata formattata in minuti/secondi) leggendo dinamicamente il file `performance_history.json`.
- **DRY Universal Timeline (UI-006)**: Unifies rendering, height (64px), Wave/Audio/Shortcut controls, and Ripple Edit physics across Stringout and Director's Cut modes. Implements mode-based dynamic legends (A-ROLL/B-ROLL/REJECTED vs PILLAR/FILLER) and accurate Click-to-Seek via target time translation.
- **BPM Grid Coordinate Fix & Propagation (UI-007)**: Restores precise alignment of analyzed audio BPM markers with the visual waveform when audio duration is shorter than video duration. Synthetically propagates the BPM grid beyond the audio timeline boundary up to the total video length, using a dashed, semi-transparent metronome styling for visual distinction.
